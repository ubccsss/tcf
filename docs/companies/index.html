				<p>We have a profound responsibility: to invest the assets belonging to 20 million
Canadians to help ensure the sustainability of the Canada Pension Plan.</p>

<p>To meet this responsibility, CPPIB was created with a singular investment
objective: to maximize returns without undue risk of loss. In doing so we are
explicitly required to act in the best interests of contributors and
beneficiaries and take into account the factors that affect the financial
obligations of the CPP.</p>

<p>Our governance model – recognized worldwide as a leading standard for national
pension plans – is critical to our ability to fulfill our responsibility. We
operate at arm’s length from government while also being strictly accountable –
through policies, regulations, and our enabling legislation.</p>

<p>Our Enterprise Risk Management framework ensures that the risks we take are
commensurate with the long-term benefits we can achieve.</p>

<p>Our belief in the importance of transparency – around what we do and how we work
– is essential to ensuring the trust and confidence of our stakeholders.
Our ability to invest for the long term – we think in terms of quarter centuries
not quarters – means we can stay the course and be driven by sound,
forward-looking thinking rather than the need for short-term gains.</p>

<p>The efficient and sophisticated platform made possible by our scale, and the
reliable source of contributions that gives certainty to our assets mean we can
seize investment opportunities when others can’t.</p>

<p>Most of all, our global team of talented and experienced professionals helps us
assume this vital responsibility and strives to meet it with integrity, mutual
respect, and professionalism. Every employee of CPPIB is motivated each day by
the opportunity to work on behalf of Canadians and to fulfill our unique
mandate.</p>

				<p>D2L was founded in 1999 by John Baker. At the time, his engineering class was being challenged to look at the world in new ways by coming up with questions that no one had asked before.</p>

<p>John realized that despite all the change technology was driving in the world, his University campus seemed almost untouched by that momentum. The question he wanted to ask was clear: how could we use technology to dramatically transform learning?</p>

<p>He’s come to believe that one of the most important things we can do to help each other is ensure that everyone has access to the best possible learning opportunities. Today, D2L is working with customers around the world to help learners at a scale that was hard to imagine in 1999.</p>

<p>D2L’s technology is currently being used by customers in higher education, K-12, healthcare, government, and the enterprise sector. In seventeen years, our team has grown to include over 750 employees around the world. We currently have offices in Canada, the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, and Singapore.</p>

				<p>Mapping has always been about discovery. For centuries, two-dimensional maps guided us through the unknown to our destination. But we are no longer limited by the edges of our physical maps.</p>

<p>In 1985, we began with the simple goal to digitize mapping and pioneer in-car navigation systems. Over the next three decades, as NAVTEQ and Nokia, we’ve built a legacy in mapping technology.</p>

<p>Today, we&rsquo;re creating living three-dimensional maps that grow upwards, breathing with layers of information and insights.</p>
