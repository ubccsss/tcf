# Need Help?

If you need any assistance during the event, you have several options:

### Find a Volunteer

Volunteers will be walking around the venue, and they'll all be sporting an awesome TCF badge so they're easy to spot.


### Visit the Info Booth

This booth is located at the front of the venue, and you probably passed it on the way in. Helpful volunteers will always be stationed here.

### Contact Us Directly

If you can't find anyone and need help right away, just contact the CSSS VP External directly. He's here to help! ðŸ™‚
