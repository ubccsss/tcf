**Overview**  
"A mission that matters

We help people see and understand their data. Eight words that drive everything we do. And they've never been more important.

In 2020 the world will generate 50 times the amount of data as in 2011 and 75 times the number of information sources (IDC, 2011). Within these data are huge opportunities for human advancement. But to turn opportunities into reality, people need the power of data at their fingertips. Tableau is building software to deliver exactly that.

Our products are transforming the way people use data to solve problems. We make analyzing data fast and easy, beautiful and useful. It's software for anyone and everyone.

We are Tableau Software."
