Axiom Zen is the venture studio behind several successful startups including Dapper Labs (the makers of CryptoKitties), ZenHub (the world's leading developer-focused project management platform), Routific (the world's leading route optimization engine), and many others. Formed in February 2018, Dapper Labs was spun out of Axiom Zen to spread the benefits of decentralization through the power of play, fairness, and true ownership. 

Axioms are humble and curious entrepreneurs, builders, and tinkerers who share a passion to demystify blockchain technology and tap its potential to create change in the world. Everyone here is a founder, and no one fits in a box. We're all driven by an insatiable thirst for learning and development, and that's what brings us together.
