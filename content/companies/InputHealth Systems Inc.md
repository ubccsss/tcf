Overview
"At InputHealth, we build tools that make value-based healthcare possible through the ubiquity of mobile devices and cloud-based technology. We are committed to establishing an eHealth ecosystem that puts patients and healthcare providers at the centre of their own care. Rather than conforming to the electronic health record model currently being used in health care settings, we have created a Collaborative Health Record that allows for sharing of chart information with patients, tracking patient-reported outcome measures, video-conferencing, and empowering patients with tools such as health notifications and electronic appointment booking."
