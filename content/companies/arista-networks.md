Arista offers a broad portfolio of Gigabit Ethernet solutions including 1,10 and 40 GbE switches that redefine network architectures, bring extensibility to networking and dramatically change the price/performance of data center networks. At the core of Arista's platform is EOS (Extensible Operating System), the world's most advanced network operating system, designed to build software defined cloud networks. EOS provides a single image consistency across hardware platforms and a modern core architecture enabling in-service upgrades and application extensibility.
