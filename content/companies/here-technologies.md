Mapping has always been about discovery. For centuries, two-dimensional maps guided us through the unknown to our destination. But we are no longer limited by the edges of our physical maps.

In 1985, we began with the simple goal to digitize mapping and pioneer in-car navigation systems. Over the next three decades, as NAVTEQ and Nokia, weâ€™ve built a legacy in mapping technology.

Today, we're creating living three-dimensional maps that grow upwards, breathing with layers of information and insights.
