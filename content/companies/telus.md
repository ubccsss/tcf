TELUS' Graduate Technology Leadership Program (GTLP) is a one-of-a-kind technical development program with a focus on technology and innovation. Through a series of rotations, the program will expose you to a breadth of functions to build your technical skills while you deliver on the technology needs of our customers.
You will complete three 9-12 month rotations choosing from five technology streams. Streams include Security, SDN / NFV, Wireless, Future Friendly Home Services, and Software Design. Positions are available in most major cities across Canada, so you can stay in one place or experience living in different parts of Canada during the program.
