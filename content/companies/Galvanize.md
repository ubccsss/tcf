What are the skills and qualities of a successful candidate in your organization?
"As a new grad or a coop, it's important for you to show a willingness and a passion to learn new things, and take on tasks that you are not sure how to accomplish. Ask for help, be respectful to others, and work well within a team. We are looking for individuals with a ""can do"" attitude that have strong computer science fundamentals."
