**In your opinion, what is the best way for UBC students to prepare for their interactions with you at the TCF?**  
"The best way for UBC students to prepare for the TCF would be to ensure they have polished resumes/cover letters ready, an idea of the types of positions they would like to see themselves in after graduation, and to perhaps have some questions prepared for us about our company and the work that we do. They should also be prepared to answer a few questions from us, and be prepared to talk about some of the projects they've worked on so far during their degree program. Also, to show up with big smiles and an open mind!"
